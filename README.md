## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gaston!

I'm fascinated by the ever-evolving dance between technology and our daily routines (and yes, that includes the profound cultural impact of a good meme). I'm on a mission to build cool things that make life a little more interesting, efficient, and secure.

ðŸŒ± **Currently Leveling Up In:**
*   Dart & Flutter (Crafting beautiful mobile experiences)
*   Firebase & Supabase (Powering applications with modern BaaS)
*   Electronics & Hardware Exploration (Bridging the physical and digital, one component at a time)
*   Ethical Hacking (Learning to defend by understanding the offense)

âš¡ **Random Pondering:** Is water *really* wet? Let's discuss!
